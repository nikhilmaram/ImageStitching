# ImageStitching
Panaroma Image Stitching using openCV and Python

Image stitching is done using openCV libray in Python.
In this program we stitch multiple images sequentially.
Left to Right stitiching is considered, so the program expects the images provided to them are in left to Right order.

To run the program : 
python src.py <directory which contains the images>
